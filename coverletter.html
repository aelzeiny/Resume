          <p><b>Software Engineer</p>
          <p>Dear Marlon Dulay,</p>
          <p>My immersion into the Twitch ecosystem began by competing in Project M, a relatively obscure game with a dwindling player base. Those of us who aggregated together were very grateful to have found an arena where players can showcase skill, express creativity, and expand the community. When Marc Moy, a current Twitch Software Engineer, referred me to this opening, I became instantly ecstatic. This is finally my chance, for reasons that I will explain, to apply to my dream occupation at my dream company.</p>
          <p>Live-streaming has become the natural companion to the international e-sports scene, and with the recent addition of the IRL section Twitch is expanding at record scale. As a new addition, I would be a part of the effort in migrating the code-base away from Ember and Ruby into the faster alternatives of React and Go. I have garnered deep and foundational experience with the React and Redux paradigm across both web and mobile platforms; as evidenced by the podcasting app I developed in Redux, PostgreSQL, and Ruby-On-Rails, and hosted on Amazons S3 servers.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, my experience on the LeanTaaS Operating-Room team allows me to leverage feature-driven and object-oriented agile development techniques to architect a data pipeline that runs a continuous stream of jobs and data-science scripts critical for updating our back-end systems. My team leverages and maintains several tools our pipeline, including custom serverless architecture, RabbitMQ, Hadoop, and AirFlow. Thus, with an academic and practical history steeped in the marriage of web and software engineering, I am immersed in the trends shaping the industrya hallmark feature of a versatile developer.</p>
          <p>In me, Twitch will gain the value of a fresh perspective, clear development vision, keen engineering insights, and tireless dedication to short-range and long-range success at scale. I am confident that my multifaceted experience in web-development paired with my passion for video gaming culture would make me a strong candidate for this position.</p>
          <p>Congratulations on your 1000th hire, and thank you for your consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to speak with you about my candidacy in greater detail.</p>
          <p>
            Sincerely,
          </p>
          <p>~ Ahmed Elzeiny</p>
