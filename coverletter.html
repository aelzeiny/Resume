          <p><b>Date:</b> 07/31/2017</p>
          <p><b>Job No:</b> 1743819</p>
          <p>Dear AT&T,</p>
          <p>It’s time for me to finally admit it out loud - I have a coding problem. In college, my passion for coding had manifested itself into a CS minor. In between my rigorous engineering courses, I always had one or two spare projects; even during finals week. The pinnacle of my epidemic transpired in my last occupation, when I became a full-stack engineer by day and structural E.I.T by late afternoon. In June of last year I graduated from civil to full-stack engineering for the City and County of San Francisco. I no longer have a coding problem; I now have a software-engineering career.</p>
          <p>The position of Automation Engineer caught my attention as it incorporates my professional experiences into a mission that I fully stand behind. Having worked as a full-stack engineer in public and private sectors before, I have not only witnessed the necessity and impact of automated systems, but I have also conceptualized, designed, and facilitated those tools. My experience with City and County of San Francisco allows me to leverage feature-driven agile and object-oriented development techniques to lead a team of multi-disciplinary engineers in developing a myriad of utilities and websites to automate legacy procedures. This includes task schedulers, web-scrapers, GIS tools, and full-stack sites developed in Java, C#, and ASP.Net Core. I have since picked up new technologies and frameworks, such as Redux, React, and Ruby, and am eager to put my new skills into practice. With an academic and practical history steeped in the marriage of web and software engineering, I am immersed in the trends shaping the industry—a hallmark feature of a versatile developer.</p>
          <p>In me, AT&amp;T will gain the value of a fresh perspective, clear development vision, keen engineering insights, and tireless dedication to short-range and long-range success at scale. I am confident that my multifaceted experience in web-development paired with my passion for design would make me a strong candidate for this position.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to the opportunity to speak with you about my candidacy in greater detail.</p>
          <p>
            Sincerely,
          </p>
          <p>~ Ahmed Elzeiny</p>
