          <p><b>Software Engineer Engineer</p>
          <p>Dear FedEx,</p>
          <p>It’s time for me to finally admit it out loud - I have a coding problem. In college, my passion for coding had manifested itself into a CS minor. In between my rigorous engineering courses, I always had one or two spare projects; even during finals week. The pinnacle of my epidemic transpired in my last occupation, when I became a full-stack engineer by day and structural E.I.T by late afternoon. In June of last year I graduated from civil to full-stack engineering for the City and County of San Francisco. I no longer have a coding problem; I now have a software-engineering career.</p>
          <p>The position of Software Engineer for FedEx caught my attention as it incorporates my professional experiences into a company that's always mobilizing (pun intended). Having worked for the San Francisco Bureau of Street-Use and Mapping, I have not only witnessed the necessity and impact of graphical information systems, but I have also conceptualized, designed, and facilitated those tools. My experience with City and County of San Francisco allows me to leverage feature-driven agile and object-oriented development techniques to lead a team of multi-disciplinary engineers in developing a myriad of utilities and websites in the Java Spring Framework and ASP.NET Core. My work often extended the scope of full-stack websites to also include task schedulers, web-scrapers, and GIS tools developed in JS, Java, Ruby, and C#. Thus, with an academic and practical history steeped in the marriage of data and software engineering, I am immersed in the trends shaping the industry—a hallmark feature of a versatile developer.</p>
          <p>In me, FedEx will gain the value of a fresh perspective, clear development vision, keen engineering insights, and tireless dedication to short-range and long-range success at scale. I am confident that my multifaceted experience in web-development paired with my passion for design would make me a strong candidate for this position.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to the opportunity to speak with you about my candidacy in greater detail.</p>
          <p>
            Sincerely,
          </p>
          <p>~ Ahmed Elzeiny</p>
