          <p>Dear IBM,</p>
          <p>It’s time for me to finally admit it out loud - I have a coding problem. In college, my passion for coding had manifested itself into a CS minor. In between my rigorous engineering courses, I always had one or two spare projects; even during finals week. The pinnacle of my epidemic transpired in my last occupation, when I became a full-stack engineer by day and structural E.I.T by late afternoon. In June of last year I graduated from civil to full-stack engineering for the City and County of San Francisco. I no longer have a coding problem; I now have a software-engineering career.</p>
          <p>IBM has always held ubiquitous recognition in the world of computing, and I believe that in a couple of years the same will hold true for the web. As a new addition to the full-stack team, I would be an integral part of the effort in not only developing RESTful services, but also ensuring that the code-base is legible, testable, and scalable. I have garnered deep and foundational experience with the React and Redux paradigm across multiple projects, which is evidenced by the podcasting app I developed in PostgreSQL, Redis, and Rails.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, my experience with City and County of San Francisco allows me to leverage feature-driven agile and object-oriented development techniques to lead a team of multi-disciplinary engineers in developing a myriad of utilities and websites. This includes task schedulers, web-scrapers, d3-visualizations, GIS tools, and full-stack sites developed in Java, C#, and ASP.Net Core. I have since picked up new technologies and frameworks, such as d3, Rails, and Node, and am eager to put my new skills into practice. With an academic and practical history steeped in the marriage of web and software engineering, I am immersed in the trends shaping the industry—a hallmark feature of a versatile developer.</p>
          <p>In me, IBM will gain the value of a fresh perspective, clear development vision, keen engineering insights, and tireless dedication to short-range and long-range success at scale. I am confident that my multifaceted experience in web-development paired with my passion for design would make me a strong candidate for this position.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to the opportunity to speak with you about my candidacy in greater detail.</p>
          <p>
            Sincerely,
          </p>
          <p>~ Ahmed Elzeiny</p>
